# This is an example task file
# The format is name$number_of_seconds_between_reminders$message
# Comments begin with '#'. Every line that isn't blank or a comment will
# be parsed as a notification. This might not be what you want.
#
# Due to the way strings are interpreted by most shells, you probably want to
# wrap the name and message in double quotes ("), especially if there are
# special characters or punctuation

# This will remind you to drink water every 20 minutes (1200 seconds)
"Water"$1200$"You should probably drink some water!"
# This will test that the program is working by spamming you every 5 seconds
